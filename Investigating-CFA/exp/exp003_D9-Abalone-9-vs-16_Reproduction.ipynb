In an earlier section of the paper, the authors say that _\"the class of [a] new [synthetic counterfactual] instance needs to be verified by the underlying ML model.\"_ This means that we use some ML model trained on the data (without CFA) to assign a class to a new synthetic counterfactual, and only keep those that were classified to be a minority instance. This seems to lead to much more reasonable synthetic counterfactuals (see visualizations of the algorithm in exp001) but, at the same time, often means that the algorithm is unable to produce a fully balanced dataset (since it may terminate early).\n",
